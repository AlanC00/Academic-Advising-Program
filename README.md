Project Overview:
This project, titled "Advising Assistance Program," was developed as part of a course requirement at SNHU CODE. The aim was to create a C++ program that assists in advising students by providing information about courses, including course codes, titles, and prerequisites. The program allows users to load course data from a CSV file, print a list of available courses, and retrieve detailed information about specific courses.

Approach to the Problem:
To address the problem, I employed fundamental concepts of C++ programming and utilized various data structures to efficiently manage and access course data. Understanding data structures was crucial for designing an effective solution, as different structures offer distinct advantages and trade-offs in terms of runtime complexity and memory usage. Through careful analysis, I selected the most suitable data structure, a balanced binary search tree, for organizing course information.

Overcoming Roadblocks:
During the development process, I encountered challenges related to file parsing, data organization, and user interaction. To overcome these obstacles, I utilized C++ libraries for file handling and string manipulation. Additionally, I adopted a modular approach to code design, separating functionalities into distinct functions to enhance readability and maintainability.

Expanding Approach to Software Design:
Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software by emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate data structures based on the specific requirements of the application. It reinforced the significance of analyzing trade-offs between runtime complexity and memory usage to achieve optimal performance. Moreover, it enhanced my understanding of modular programming practices, enabling easier code maintenance and future enhancements.

Evolution of Program Writing Practices:
Through this project, I gained insights into writing programs that prioritize maintainability, readability, and adaptability. By adhering to best practices such as meaningful variable naming, proper code indentation, and concise function definitions, I enhanced the clarity and comprehensibility of the codebase. Moreover, I incorporated error handling mechanisms to improve program robustness and user experience.

Overall, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in software development, reinforcing core programming principles and fostering a deeper understanding of data structures and algorithmic efficiency.
